# AI_beta Project

## Overview
This project provides a lightweight framework for experimenting with small language models using Hugging Face and PyTorch. It includes utilities for model loading, inference, and vocabulary management, as well as automation scripts for development tasks.

## Directory Structure
- `src/` — Main source code for the project
- `llm_sdk/` — SDK for working with small LLMs
- `input/` — Input files for the main program
- `output/` — Output files generated by the main program
- `tests/` — Test suite
- `Makefile` — Automation for common development tasks

## Setup
1. Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast Python dependency management.
2. Run `make install` to set up the environment and install dependencies (numpy, pydantic, flake8, etc).

## Usage
- Run the main program:
  ```bash
  make run
  ```
- Debug the main program:
  ```bash
  make debug
  ```
- Clean up temporary files:
  ```bash
  make clean
  ```
- Lint the code:
  ```bash
  make lint
  ```

## Main Features
- Loads and runs small language models from Hugging Face Hub
- Automatically selects the best device (CPU, GPU, or Apple Silicon)
- Provides helpers for tokenization, inference, and vocabulary access
- Automates repetitive tasks with Makefile targets

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- uv
- numpy
- pydantic
- flake8
- torch
- transformers
- huggingface_hub
